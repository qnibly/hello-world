# hello-world
I am a student of Computer Science. I like to study just about everything. I love my boyfriend. Mostly I am happy, fun, sleepy, and outgoing. I created this account to get more practice coding and collaborating. 
My current future goals include:
-learning data structures and algorithms
-learning C#
-learning unity
-learning unreal engine

Thats all
